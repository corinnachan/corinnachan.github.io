	<h3><a href="http://corinnachan.com/demo-site/"> One-page demo site </a></h3>
	<p>Using primarily HTML and CSS, I built this site from the lens of a developer looking to have a basic one-page site to promote
	his / her services. This is an example site that can also be replicated and extended for sole proprietors or small businesses looking to have
	a basic online presence for minimal annual maintenance fees.

	<h3><a href="http://corinnachan.com/to-do-app"> Web-based To Do App</a></h3>
	<p>This is a web-based to-do list app built on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, using the TDD approach. In addition to 
	practicing TDD steps, I also learned to apply DOM manipulation techniques
	to create dynamic changes on the page based on the user's actions (e.g. button clicks).
